To install x2dhf, you need CMake version 2.6 or greater.

The installation is very simple. First, create a build directory
$ mkdir objdir
and go there
$ cd objdir

Next, you can configure x2dhf with
$ cmake ..
Once CMake has finished determining the compile options, you can compile
the program in parallel e.g. on four cores with
$ make -j4
To install the program run
$ make install

By default the program installs under the bin/ directory in the source
tree.  You can select the installation location with e.g.
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/bin

If you want to override the compiler flags used in the build, you can
specify them in the cmake command as e.g.
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS_RELEASE:STRING="-O3 -ffast-math"

If CMake does not detect the Fortran compiler you want to use, you can
specify it with the FC environment variable, e.g.
$ export FC=ifort
To force redetection of the compiler, you just need to remove CMake's cache
$ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/
