To install x2dhf, you need CMake version 2.6 or greater, and a Fortran
90 compiler.

The installation is very simple: just run compile.sh. This will
compile the program and install it under bin/ in the present
directory.

By default x2dhf is compiled using gfortran with -O2 -Wall. If you
want to change the compiler or the flags, edit the first lines of
compile.sh.
