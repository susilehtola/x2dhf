# Two-Dimensional Finite Difference Hartree-Fock program for diatomic molecules
                                                                            
This program finds virtually exact solutions of the Hartree-Fock and
density functional theory equations for diatomic molecules and atoms
(the quality of a solution depends on grid size and arithmetic
precision used). The lowest energy eigenstates of a given irreducible
representation and spin can be obtained.

The program can be also be used to obtain the ground and excited
states of one-electron systems with the (smoothed) Coulomb and
Kramers-Hennenberger potentials.

Single particle two-dimensional numerical functions (orbitals) are
used to construct an antisymmetric many-electron wave function of the
restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock model. The orbitals are obtained by
solving the Hartree-Fock equations in the form of the coupled
two-dimensional second-order (elliptic) partial differential equations
(PDE). The Coulomb and exchange potentials are obtained as solutions
of the corresponding Poisson equations. The PDEs are disretized by the
8th-order central difference stencil on a two-dimensional grid and the
resulting large and sparse system of linear equations is solved by the
(multicolour) successive overrelaxation method ((MC)SOR). The
self-consistent-field iterations are interwoven with the (MC)SOR ones
and orbital energies and normalization factors are used to monitor the
convergence. The accuracy of solutions depends mainly on the grid and
the system under consideration.
